# Design Goals

- Use as little boilerplate as possible
- Use technologies that will last for a while
- Dev experience should feel fast

# Architecture Decisions

- Use typescript as a main language for the workspace
- Use docker-compose?
- Use rust for backends (but use package.json for actions)
- Main verbs: start, dev, build, test, deploy

# TODO

- [ ] Decide what software design problems to simulate
- [ ] Decide documentation structure
- [ ] Decide deployment setup
- [ ] Make basic backend setup
- [ ] Make basic web frontend setup
- [ ] Make basic mobile frontend setup
